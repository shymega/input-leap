  <description>Input Leap lets you easily share your mouse and keyboard between multiple computers, where each computer has its
own display. No special hardware is required, all you need is a local area network. Input Leap is supported on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse off the edge of your screen.</description>
